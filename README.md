# Project Title
Adgreen: Implementing machine learning classification to analyse future trends, make better decisions and 
#Overview
Amazon is one of the leading ecommerce logistic providers that leverages advertisements in digital marketing.The number of advertisements sent out are continuos and frequently inefficient because users get frustrated by the amount of untailored advertisements they receive. We have come up with Adgreen, a machine learning framework to evaluate the perfomance of advertisements sent out on Amazon's website.This evaluation metric is important to gauge the advertisement reach, impact on customer engagement whilst increasing ad efficiency.

Future Mapping:

Future Plans for AI Integration and Trend Predictive Analysis
Objective
To integrate the Adgreen model with AI agents to enable autonomous learning from new data and perform predictive analysis on advertisement trends, thereby enhancing the modelâ€™s adaptability and precision in real-time environments.

Strategy
AI Agent Integration
Development of AI Agents:

Design and Implement AI Agents: Develop AI agents capable of interacting with the Adgreen machine learning model, receiving new data inputs, and analyzing performance metrics.

Automated Learning Algorithms: Implement algorithms that enable AI agents to learn continuously from new data, improving their prediction accuracy and decision-making capabilities over time.

Real-Time Data Acquisition:

Continuous Data Stream: Establish data pipelines that provide a steady stream of new data related to advertisement performance, user behavior, and engagement metrics.

Data Preprocessing: Develop preprocessing mechanisms to ensure data quality and consistency before feeding it to the AI agents.

Predictive Analysis
Trend Analysis Models:

Implement Predictive Models: Incorporate trend analysis models within the AI agents to predict future trends based on historical and real-time data.

Adaptive Learning: Enable models to adapt to changing trends by continuously updating their parameters based on new data inputs.

Performance Evaluation and Feedback Loop:

Continuous Evaluation: Set up a feedback loop for continuous evaluation of the AI agents' performance, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and user engagement.

Iterative Improvements: Use the feedback to iteratively improve the model and AI agents, ensuring their predictions and decisions become increasingly accurate over time.

Scalability and Robustness
Scalable Infrastructure:

Cloud Integration: Utilize cloud-based platforms to ensure the scalability and robustness of the AI agents and data processing pipelines.

Resource Allocation: Implement dynamic resource allocation to manage computational load efficiently and maintain performance during peak times.

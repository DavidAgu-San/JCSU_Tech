How to run:
- Ensure you have the OpenAI Python package installed. If not, install it using:
    pip install openai
- Import the required OpenAI client in your script
    from openai import OpenAI
- Aquire and define API key where data is located at
- Run the Script
  python your_script.py



The script imports and initializes an OpenAI client using an API key.

The Agent class then, encapsulates the properties and behaviors of different AI agents.
Each agent has a name and instructions that define its specific role.
The process method enables interaction with OpenAIâ€™s API, generating responses based on the provided input.
(Multi-Agent Architecture)

The system uses multiple AI agents, each assigned a unique responsibility:
Agent1 (data scanner): Identifies components of the dataset.
Agent2 (data analysis): Provides a summary and insights.
Agent3 (data reporter): Cleans and refines the analysis.
Agent4 (data decider): Makes unbiased decisions based on user interaction and location.
Agent5 (data improver): Receives feedback to enhance AI service quality.
Structured Data Processing

The dataset contains various attributes such as:
Daily Internet Usage
Age
Area Income
Clicked on Ad (Yes/No)
These attributes are analyzed for insights and decision-making.
Sequential Data Processing Flow

The raw dataset (document) is first analyzed by Agent2.
The output is then refined by Agent3 before further actions are taken.
